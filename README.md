# War Card Game

A Python implementation of the classic card game "War." In this game, two players (the user and the computer) compete by drawing cards from their respective decks. The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards. The game continues until one player collects all the cards or chooses to quit.

## Features
- **Player vs. Computer**: The player faces off against the computer in this classic game of War.
- **Deck Shuffling**: The deck is shuffled at the start of the game for randomness.
- **Card Drawing**: Players draw cards from their decks, and the winner is determined based on the value of the cards.
- **War Mechanism**: In the event of a tie, a "war" occurs where additional cards are drawn to break the tie.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when one player has no more cards left in their deck.
